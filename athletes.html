                   <h3>1. Michael Phelps: Swimming, United States </h3>
                   Michael Phelps is without a doubt the best Olympic athlete in history. Not only did he win eight gold medals in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, he also won six gold medals and two bronze medals in the 2004 Olympics. Those eight gold medals eclipsed Mark Spitz's record of seven in the 1972 Munich Olympics. He already holds the record for the most gold medals in the Olympics, and with three more medals in London, he'll become the most decorated Olympic athlete in history.

                   <h3>2. Larisa Semyonovna Latynina: Gymnastics, Soviet Union</h3> 
                   Larisa Semyonovna Latynina holds the record for most overall Olympic medals with 18 in gymnastics. She was responsible for establishing the Soviet Union's dominance in gymnastics. In 1956, she won gold medals in the team competition, all-around, floor exercise and vault, while taking the silver medal on the uneven bars and the bronze in the team event with portable apparatus. In the 1960 Rome Olympics, Latynina won gold in the team event, all-around, floor exercise, she took silver in the balance beam and uneven bars and the bronze in the vault. She competed as well in the 1964 Olympics, although she was not as successful. Her final total before retiring was nine golds, five silvers and four bronzes.

                    <h3>3. Carl Lewis: Track and Field, United States</h3> 
                     Carl Lewis is the greatest track and field athlete in Olympic history. He was an Olympic mainstay from 1984 to 1996. In 1984, he won gold in the 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump and 400-meter relay. In the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, he took gold in the 100 meters and long jump, while taking a silver in the 200 meters. At the 1992 Olympics, he won gold in the 400-meter relay and long jump, finishing out his career in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics with a gold in the long jump. Never before has an athlete dominated for so long at so many events in Olympic track and field. Had it not been for the next two, he would be the greatest Olympic athlete of all time

                  <h3> 4. Mark Spitz: Swimming, United States</h3> 
                  Mark Spitz held the record for most gold medals in a single Olympics, winning seven. That record stood until Michael Phelps broke it in the 2008 Olympics. His victories came in the 100-meter butterfly, 100-meter freestyle, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter freestyle, 400-meter freestyle relay, 400-meter medley relay and 800-meter freestyle relay. Prior to that, he won two golds, a silver and a bronze in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. His golds came in the 400- and 800-meter freestyle relays, while he won silver in the 100-meter butterfly and bronze in the 100-meter freestyle When it came to being the first high-endurance athlete at a single Olympics, Spitz was that guy. And without his record-setting performance, I wonder if Phelps would have been driven so much to go for eight golds.

                    </h3>
                     Jesse Owens pulled off four gold medals under incredible pressure at the Berlin Games in 1936. German leader Adolf Hitler saw the Games as a chance to show Aryans to be the "master race." Boy, did Owens show him. Owens took gold in the 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump and 400-meter relay. The long jump victory came on the heels of advice given to him by Luz Long, the German competitor he ultimately defeated.

                    <h3>6. Nikolay Andrianov: Gymnastics, Soviet Unio</h3>
                    Nikolay Andrianov was the most successful male Olympic athlete, well, until Michael Phelps came along. Andrianov started his Olympic reign in 1972 in which he won gold in the floor exercise, silver in the team competition and bronze in the vault. In 1976, he won gold in the all-around, floor exercise, rings and vault, also winning silver in the team competition and parallel bars and bronze on the pommel horse. For the 1980 Olympics, he won gold in the team competition and vault, silver in the all-around and floor exercise and bronze on the horizontal bar.

                    <h3>7. Jim Thorpe: Track and Field, United States</h3>
                    Possibly considered the best all-around athlete in the history of the modern world, and although he only competed in one Olympics, he was still very dominant in those Olympics. He won gold in the pentathlon and decathlon in the 1912 Olympics. However, in 1913, strict rules regarding amateurism were put into effect for Olympic athletes. Because Thorpe had been paid money to play baseball, although a very meager amount, he was no longer considered an amateur, and thus declared ineligible to compete in the Olympics.

                    Kristin Otto competed in only one Olympics (1988) for East Germany. In that one Olympics, she won six gold medals, dominating her competition. The events she won were the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 100-meter backstroke and the 400-meter freestyle and 400-meter medley relays.

                    Nadia Comaneci is best known for scoring the first perfect 10 ever in Olympic gymnastics. During her time in the Olympics, she won five golds, three silvers and one bronze. In the 1976 Olympics, during the team competition in which Romania was on the uneven bars, Comaneci scored her perfect 10. At those Olympics, she won gold in the all-around, uneven bars and balance beam, while winning silver in the team competition and bronze on the floor exercise. In 1980, she won gold on the balance beam and floor exercise, while winning silver in the team competition and all-around.

                    <h3>10. Sawao Kato: Gymnastics, Japan </h3>
                    In three Olympics, Sawao Kato won 12 medals in gymnastics for Japan. Kato started competing in 1968, when he took gold in the team event, all-around, floor exercise and bronze in the rings. In 1972, he won gold in the team event, all-around and parallel bars, while taking silver in the horizontal bar and pommel horse. Kato fell short in the 1976 Olympics in the all-around as he fell to the Soviet Union's Nikolai Andrianov, but he did take gold in the team competition and parallel bars. Kato is one of 10 athletes to have won eight or more gold medals, becoming one of the most decorated male gymnasts in history, and the most decorated Japanese athlete in Olympic history.
