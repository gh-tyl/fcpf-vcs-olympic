                                Judo was founded in 1882 in Japan by Jigoro Kano, who modified the more dangerous techniques in ju-jitsu and developed Judo from a martial art to a sport. He also gave Judo a physical education emphasis and a strong moral orientation.

                                Judo competitions at the Olympic Games will be in the form of a single-elimination tournament to determine the gold and silver medalists. The field will be split into two tables, with the winner from both tables advancing to the Gold Medal Match. The top eight judokas in each weight class will be seeded in order to avoid top competitors facing each other early in the tournament. All other judokas will have their spots on the bracket determined by a random draw.

                                All men's matches will be allotted five minutes of regulation time, and women's matches will be allotted four minutes.

                    Paralympic history began in 1948 at a hospital for war veterans in Stoke Mandeville. German neurologist Sir Ludwig Guttman was looking for a way to help his paraplegic patients, all World War II veterans, rehabilitate more quickly. His specialised unit was made up Royal Air Force pilots with spinal cord injuries, who all needed to use wheelchairs. Dr Guttman organised sporting events as the Olympic Games took place in London.

                <p>
                    Sixteen veterans in wheelchairs faced off in archery and netball competitions, the latter sport already practised by American returning soldiers; by organising these competitions, Dr Guttman had unknowingly created a new sporting movement.

                <p>
                    International Stoke Mandeville Games were held in 1952, when a team of veterans from the Netherlands competed alongside the British teams. From then on, the Games were held every year. After that the games became more popular and in 1960 the first Paralympic Games, took place in Rome. Twenty three nations took part, sending 400 athletes — all in wheelchairs — who competed in eight sports: para athletics, wheelchair basketball, para swimming, para table tennis, para archery, snooker, dartchery (a combination of darts and archery) and wheelchair fencing.

                <p>
                    After that, the paralympic games were more structured and started to happens every four years and evolving with more sports and athletes to this amazing competition.

                            The Olympic torch is a reminder of the Games’ Greek origins.
                            In ancient times, a flame burned throughout the Games as a tribute to the goddess, Hestia. Since 1928, this tradition has continued in the modern Games, but instead of an altar, the flame burns in a special torch.
                        </p>
                        <p class="accordion-body">
                            The torch flame is always lit by the sun in Olympia, Greece, as this is where the first Greek Games was held. Then, it’s passed from torch to torch in a massive international relay that ends in the host city – wow! New torches are designed for each Olympics, and several thousand copies are made. It’s a great honour to become a torchbearer, and lots of inspiring people get a turn each time.

                            The Olympic rings were first produced in 1913, from a design created by the Games’ modern founder – Baron Pierre de Coubertin! Their five colours (along with the white backdrop) reflect colours found on the flags of all participating nations, so everyone is represented. The overlaps also represent international cooperation.
