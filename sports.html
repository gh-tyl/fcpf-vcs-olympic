                <h2>paralympics games</h2>
                <p>
                    Paralympic history began in 1948 at a hospital for war veterans in Stoke Mandeville. German neurologist Sir Ludwig Guttman was looking for a way to help his paraplegic patients, all World War II veterans, rehabilitate more quickly. His specialised unit was made up Royal Air Force pilots with spinal cord injuries, who all needed to use wheelchairs. Dr Guttman organised sporting events as the Olympic Games took place in London.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sixteen veterans in wheelchairs faced off in archery and netball competitions, the latter sport already practised by American returning soldiers; by organising these competitions, Dr Guttman had unknowingly created a new sporting movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    International Stoke Mandeville Games were held in 1952, when a team of veterans from the Netherlands competed alongside the British teams. From then on, the Games were held every year. After that the games became more popular and in 1960 the first Paralympic Games, took place in Rome. Twenty three nations took part, sending 400 athletes — all in wheelchairs — who competed in eight sports: para athletics, wheelchair basketball, para swimming, para table tennis, para archery, snooker, dartchery (a combination of darts and archery) and wheelchair fencing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, the paralympic games were more structured and started to happens every four years and evolving with more sports and athletes to this amazing competition.
